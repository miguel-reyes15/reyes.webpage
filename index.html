            <h3>Types</h3>
            <p>
                Collectors often specialize in specific categories of Mustangs. Some focus on the first-generation models from the 1960s and 1970s, celebrated for their classic designs and association with muscle car culture. Others are drawn to rare and limited-edition models, such as the Shelby GT500, Boss 302, or Mach 1, which represent the pinnacle of Mustang engineering. Additionally, modern iterations, like the fifth and sixth generations, attract collectors who appreciate contemporary performance blended with retro aesthetics.
